# CELLO-3.0

CELLO-3.0 is a software package for designing and simulating genetic circuits. It includes a core cell-logic synthesis process, an interactive shell interface, and a Python package that can be used as a component in other software. CELLO-3.0 is designed to be lightweight, error-proof, and capable of handling both inter-cellular partitioning and intra-cellular partitioning.

## Installation

To install CELLO-3.0, simply clone the repository and run the setup script:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cello-3.0.git
cd cello-3.0
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

CELLO-3.0 can be used in a variety of ways, depending on your needs:

As a standalone tool: Use the interactive shell interface to design and simulate genetic circuits.
As a Python package: Import the core CELLO code as a Python library and use it as a component in your own software.
As a website: Use the Cello3.0 website, built in Python, to run CELLO-3.0.
CELLO-3.0 includes a proprietary UCF formatter tool that can modify or create UCF files from a website, allowing for intuitive editing of the data inside. Users can also download UCF files from the website.
